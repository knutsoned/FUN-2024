Title card: Dungeon Crawler: The Musical 3
Subtitle: Ottoman Invasion

Expo card (1984): Professor Alger L. Elgar was denied tenure at the University of Quercus. They left to form SoffiTech, releasing the original Ex. video game SDK three years later, along with a flagship launch title, a little something called Marbles Missing. 

Expo card (1989): After the smashing success of MM, as well as subsequent hits like NPC 2: Fishing Trip, Unlock, and the seminal Dishwasher Commander 14, Ex. grew to encompass cutting edge 2D and 3D animation and rendering, as well as pioneering techniques involving AI, fractals, evolution computing, and at least 3 other scifi-soundingish buzz words. GPT!

Expo card (2009): Overextended and facing insolvency, SoffiTech fired its entire staff and completely ceased operations. The headquarters building was unceremoniously shuttered, the employees left unpaid, and Elgar has not been seen since.

Expo card (2023): A rogue AI operating a Micronesian manufacturing plant began to ship thousands and thousands of ottoman footstools around the globe. The source of the rampant code, named LINL (like the ThunderCat), which activates a murderous rampage mode on delivery, was traced to the long-thought empty HQ of SoffiTech.

Expo card (2024): Apparently, Elgar left a laptop plugged in or something. It took over logistics for a major supplier and got "auto" confused with "otto" and started automatically shipping ottomans to every known address in the world. And they all want to kill you for some reason.
For you are once again Manuel Anular, leader of the Spanish Exposition. Your mission is to find and shutdown the laptop, if not Elgar himself! And above all else...
