Title card: Dungeon Crawler: The Musical 3
Subtitle: Ottoman Invasion

Expo card (1984): Professor Alger L. Elgar was denied tenure at the University of Quercus. They left to form SoffiTech, releasing the original Ex. video game SDK three years later, along with a flagship launch title, a little something called Marbles Missing. After the smashing success of MM, SoffiTech grew too big, too fast, and starting work on Dishwasher Commander.

Expo card (1999): After hits like NPC 2: Fishing Trip, Unlock, and the seminal Dishwasher Commander 14, SoffiTech coasted by the Y2K bug (the code base had no concept of a date format). Ten years later, overextended and facing insolvency, SoffiTech fired its entire staff and abruptly ceased operations. The headquarters was unceremoniously shuttered. The employees were never paid.

Expo card (2023): Elgar has not been seen for 15 years. A rogue AI operating a Micronesian manufacturing plant began to ship thousands and thousands of ottoman footstools around the globe. The source of the rampant code, named LINL (like the ThunderCat), which activates a murderous rampage mode on delivery, was traced to the long-thought empty HQ of SoffiTech.

Expo card (2024): Apparently, Elgar left a laptop plugged in or something. It took over logistics for a major supplier and got "auto" confused with "otto" and started automatically shipping ottomans to every known address in the world. And they all want to kill you for some reason.

Expo card (start):
For you are once again Manuel Anular, leader of the Spanish Exposition. Your mission is to find and shutdown the laptop, if not Elgar himself! And above all else...
