Title card: Dungeon Crawler: The Musical 3
Subtitle: Ottoman Invasion

Expo card (1984): Professor Alger L. Elgar forms SoffiTech.

Expo card (2023): Elgar has not been seen for 15 years. A rogue AI operating a Micronesian manufacturing plant begins to ship thousands and thousands of ottoman footstools around the globe. The rampant code, named LINL (like the ThunderCat) activates a murderous rampage mode on delivery. The Spanish Exposition traces its source to the long-thought empty HQ of SoffiTech.

Expo card (2024): Apparently, Elgar left a laptop plugged in or something. It had taken over logistics for a major supplier and got "auto" confused with "otto," then began automatically shipping ottomans to every known address in the world. And they all want to kill you for some reason.

Expo card (start):
WARNING: LINL can pass a Voigt-Kampff test but has failed the Bechdel test twice.

You are Manuel Anular, leader of the Spanish Exposition. Your mission is to find and shutdown the laptop, if not Elgar himself! And above all else...

REMAIN INDOORS

Console view: You begin in the lobby of the SoffiTech building. There are 3 exits. One door leads outside, to the ottoman horde. The other doors lead deeper into the complex. Solve the puzzle and stay alive. And turn off the ottoman autoship, those notifications are driving me up the wall!
